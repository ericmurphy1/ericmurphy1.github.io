Completing this interactive gallery was definitely one of the more difficult assignments to achieve. 

I decided to keep the gallery fairly simple only including my name, the assignment name and the photos. The most difficult part of the assignment was figuring out the modal, especially finding the proper external resources to assist in writing the correct code. I had to make constant adjustments on my css file to have the sizing work to the best of my ability. Once that was achieved it was fairly quick to style the gallery in CSS with colour and font choices, unifying the page. 

Thankfully from this assignment I can now use this webpage as a guideline whenever I need to implement modals into my code, especially when working with images.
